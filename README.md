# ERDA
**ERDA** (Emergency Response Data Analysis) is an effort to apply statistical analysis to emergency response data obtained from the city of Washington, DC.

The data (in raw and preprocessed forms) can be downloaded from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BytkaupSbV7SSnpBV19WcG1nQ0E&usp=sharing).

For more information about the data and our analysis, see the [wiki](https://github.com/CodeForDC-ERDA/ERDA/wiki). Notes on the progress of this project and ideas for next steps can be found on the [Hackpad](https://hackpad.com/Emergency-Response-DmrRNw6nxqj).
